Coldfusion back-end, HTML/jQuery front-end, pulls members from a database

This is an example of using HTML and jQuery on the front end to make an ajax call to a Coldfusion CFC. The Coldfusion CFC queries a database to pull members and
returns the data as JSON.

The jQuery front-end code pulls the data and outputs it for the user.

The database is not provided.
